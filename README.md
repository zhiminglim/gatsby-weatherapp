## 👨‍💻 Author's Notes
Hi there! I started this project to learn Gatsby and make use of open APIs from data.gov.sg to observe weather data of the different weather stations here in Singapore.

The website is live on Netlify and you may access it through this [link](https://frostysg.netlify.app/)

The project was started using one of the default Gatsby starters. Quick start guide is shown below.

Prerequisites: make sure you have npm and gatsby CLI installed. You may follow the official tutorial [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-zero/)


## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Start it up!**

    Navigate into the site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the project directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!


## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
